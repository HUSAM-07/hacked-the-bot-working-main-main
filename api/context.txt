Scope and Objective of the Course:
The course explores the concepts and techniques of data mining, a promising and flourishing frontier in
database systems. Data Mining is automated extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored
in large databases, data warehouses, and other massive information repositories. It is a decision support
tool that addresses unique decision support problems that cannot be solved by other data analysis tools
such as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). The course covers data mining tasks like constructing decision
trees, finding association rules, classification, and clustering. The course is designed to provide students
with a broad understanding in the design and use of data mining algorithms. The course also aims at
providing a holistic view of data mining. It will have database, statistical, algorithmic and application
perspectives of data mining. Students will also get to apply the DM concepts using Python.

Mid-sem Grading:
Mid-sem grading will be displayed after two evaluation components or earlier whenever about 40% of
evaluation components are completed.
Note: A student will be likely to get “NC”, if he / she doesn’t appear / appear for the sake of appearing
for the evaluation components / scoring zero in pre-compre total.

Makeup and Attendance policies:
Make-ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the genuineness of the circumstances
under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. In such circumstances, prior
permission should be obtained from the Instructor-in-Charge (I/C). Students with less than 50% of
attendance will not be allowed to avail the make-ups. The decision of the I/C in the above matter will be
final.

Attendance: Every student is expected to be responsible for regularity of his/her attendance in class rooms
and laboratories, to appear in scheduled tests and examinations and fulfill all other tasks assigned to him/her
in every course. A student should have a minimum of 60% of attendance in a course to be eligible to appear
for the Comprehensive Examination in that course. For the students under the purview of Academic
Counseling Board (ACB), the Board shall prescribe the minimum attendance requirement on a case-to-case
basis. Attendance in the course will be a deciding factor in judging the seriousness of a student which may
be directly / indirectly related to grading.

General timings for consultation:
Chamber consultation hour: Friday 5th hour

General instructions:
Students should come prepared for classes and carry the text book(s) or material(s) as prescribed by the
Course Faculty to the class.

Notices:
All notices concerning the course will be displayed on the CS department Notice Board and on LMS Moodle.
Students are also informed to check their BITS email (regularly) for any communication regarding the course.

Scope and objective of the course:
This course introduces students to basic concepts and methods of artificial intelligence from a computer
science perspective. AI concerns itself with a certain set of problems and develops a particular body of
techniques for approaching these problems. The focus of the course will be on the study of methods of
knowledge representation, reasoning, and algorithms required for the development of intelligent
programs. AI not only strives to build intelligent entities, but also allows understanding them. This course
will empower the students to know how to program computers, using classical symbolic methods, to
behave in ways normally attributed to "intelligence" when observed in humans. AI currently
encompasses a huge variety of sub fields, like perception, logical reasoning, proving mathematical
theorems, and diagnosing diseases etc. AI empowers the computer engineers to systematize and
automate the intellectual tasks, with the help of a set of tools, and methodologies. The methods studied
in this course can be applied in any area of human intellectual endeavor.
The assignments / laboratory components will emphasize the use of C, C++,Java but predominantly
Python or any other language of student’s interest. The students will be asked to implement the use of
Search strategies in real world problem solving, Game playing programs like chess or tic-tac-toe,
Planners, Small Expert system shell with only inference engine, Programs for reasoning under
uncertainties using models like TMS or Bayes’ Networks, Natural Language understanding programs,
and Programs in the area of Machine learning using connectionist models like neural networks or using
symbolic models.

Mid-sem Grading:
Mid-sem grading will be displayed after midsem test whenever about 30% of evaluation components
are completed.
Note: A student will be likely to get “NC”, if he / she doesn’t appear / appear for the sake of appearing
for the evaluation components / scoring zero in pre-compre total / scoring zero in comprehensive
examination.
Makeup and Attendance policies:
Make-ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the genuineness of the
circumstances under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. In such
circumstances, prior permission should be obtained from the Instructor-in-Charge (I/C). Students with
less than 60% of attendance will not be allowed to avail the make-ups. The decision of the I/C in the
above matter will be final.
Attendance:
Every student is expected to be responsible for regularity of his/her attendance in class rooms and
laboratories, to appear in scheduled tests and examinations and fulfill all other tasks assigned to
him/her in every course. A student should have a minimum of 60% of attendance in a course to be
eligible to appear for the Comprehensive Examination in that course. For the students under the
purview of Academic Counseling Board (ACB), the Board shall prescribe the minimum attendance

requirement on a case-to-case basis. Attendance in the course will be a deciding factor in judging the
seriousness of a student which may be directly / indirectly related to grading.

Mid-sem Grading:
Mid-sem grading will be displayed after three evaluation components or earlier whenever about 40
% of evaluation components are completed.
Note: A student will be likely to get “NC”, if he / she
● Doesn’t appear / appear for the sake of appearing for the evaluation components / scoring
zero in pre-compre total.
● Scoring zero in the lab component / Abstaining from lab classes throughout.
Makeup and Attendance policies:
Make-ups are not given as a routine. It is solely dependent upon the genuineness of the
circumstances under which a student fails to appear in a scheduled evaluation component. In such
circumstances, prior permission should be obtained from the Instructor-in-Charge (I/C).The
decision of the I/C in the above matter will be final.
Attendance: Every student is expected to be responsible for regularity of his/her attendance in class
rooms and laboratories, to appear in scheduled tests and examinations and fulfill all other tasks
assigned to him/her in every course. A student should have a minimum of 60% of attendance in a
course to be eligible to appear for the Comprehensive Examination in that course. For the students
under the purview of Academic Counseling Board (ACB), the Board shall prescribe the minimum
attendance requirement on a case-to-case basis. Attendance in the course will be a deciding factor
in judging the seriousness of a student which may be directly / indirectly related to grading.
General instructions:
Students should come prepared for classes and carry the text book(s) or material(s) as prescribed
by the Course Faculty to the class.
Notices: All notices concerning the course will be displayed on the respective Notice Boards and
Google class room. Optionally, if there is a need, email to your BITS mail would be used on short
