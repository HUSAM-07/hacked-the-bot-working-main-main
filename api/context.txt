Scope and Objective of the Course:
The course explores the concepts and techniques of data mining, a promising and flourishing frontier in
database systems. Data Mining is automated extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored
in large databases, data warehouses, and other massive information repositories. It is a decision support
tool that addresses unique decision support problems that cannot be solved by other data analysis tools
such as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). The course covers data mining tasks like constructing decision
trees, finding association rules, classification, and clustering. The course is designed to provide students
with a broad understanding in the design and use of data mining algorithms. The course also aims at
providing a holistic view of data mining. It will have database, statistical, algorithmic and application
perspectives of data mining. Students will also get to apply the DM concepts using Python.

Catalog Description and Objectives:
Machine Learning is an exciting sub-area of Artificial Intelligence which deals with designing machines
which can learn and improve their performance from examples/experience. This course introduces the
student to the key algorithms and theory that forms the core of machine learning. The course will cover the
major approaches to learning namely, supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement
leaning. The course emphasizes various techniques, which have become feasible with increased
computational power and our ability to produce and capture huge volumes of data. The topics covered in the
course include regression, decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, Bayesian
techniques, Hidden Markov models etc. Some advanced topics like active, deep & topological learning will
also be covered.
